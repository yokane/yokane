        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Largo is the slowest of the speed signatures that follow largo, lento, and adagio, at about 40-50 bpm. Largo's speed is described as "broad and very slow." Largo is found in Caccini's <em>New Music</em> Dhe, dove son fuggiti of 1601. The slow, languid tone of "Ombra mai fu" makes us lose track of time. But the sound continues to flow. It is gentle, supple, and simply, beautiful.</p>
        <p>The medieval European philosophy of scholasticism originated in Aristotle's philosophy, and σχολη is the root of the word "school" and means leisure. Huizinga's <em>Homo Ludens</em> appeals that play is the essence of human nature. Roger Caillois, the usual Roger Caillois, says in essence that there are four kinds of play.</p>
        <p><strong>Talent vs Luck: the role of randomness in success and failure</strong> shows that talent has no meaning, but the environment does. By providing a place on the second side of the 8:2 law, even the most marginalized person with odd biorhythms can be made more vital with time and play if AI is used properly. Aristotle's philosophy is just some kind of inspiration for people who have slaves, who have no trouble making a living, and who have time on their hands, when they look blankly at the sky. That is the most necessary essence of science, and it is reduced to literature and art by allowing the minimum amount of slowness that humans can tolerate. AI is used for this purpose.</p>

        <h2>Our Company Rules</h2>
        <p>Specifically, we will create a system to enable three working days and four holidays. I am still in the planning stage, but as a former recruitment examiner or a nationally accredited engineer, I know what is good and what is not, so I will use a meritocracy. We have created LangChain, which is a very competitive internal knowledge system, so if you write a daily report, it will be reflected in Redmine and we can take over without a hitch. We also use Whisper to take minutes, so we don't do any work that doesn't make sense. The server is easy to tinker with, so we set it up on Discord.</p>
        <p>I can't support anyone's annual income, but if you have computer problems, please contact me. I'd like to do business with small jobs, depending on the type, and build up trust one by one.</p>
